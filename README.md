## Ontology Extension through Retrieval-Augmented Generation

OntoExtend is a Python-based system that automatically generates ontology extensions from competency questions using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system leverages existing ontology design patterns (ODPs) and core ontologies to create semantically consistent TTL/OWL fragments.
